The **CityMe** project aims at creating a framework for mapping, exploring and analyzing official and non-official neighborhoods, regions of interest, districts and other areas that constitute peopleâ€™s mental map of the city. By harvesting data from our **map-based application** and social media platforms, we can better understand how citizens spatially reason about administrative and non-administrative regions in the urban landscape, such as parishes, residential areas, informal neighborhoods, historical centers and commercial areas.

<p>Through applying state-of-the-art spatial analysis, our framework can be applied to other cities in order to improve and enhance participatory urban planning, citizen-engagement in public policies and projects in smart cities. **CityMe** is not only restricted to characterizing different types of regions in the city, but it is also committed to contributing to the efforts of making cities more human through citizen-centered, transparent and bottom-up approaches in various applications in the context of urban intelligence.</p>
